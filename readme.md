# Portfolio site
A porfolio of past projects that demonstrates familiarity with a number of current frontend techniques.

##Setup
the index page is created with Jade and then built (in my case) with [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/)

### background
Sass and jquery are in use, and this project started with a [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) framework.

## Parallax 

Parallax was implemented starting with[ this video Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4IyCbhul-PdeiDqmh4ooJzk) on the [DevTips](https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners) Channel

## Images

The images folder is a mix of stuff I made and stuff from the Parallax demo. I should fix that...

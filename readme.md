# Portfolio site
A porfolio of past projects that demonstrates familiarity with a number of current frontend techniques.

##Setup
the index page is created with Jade and then built (in my case) with [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/)

### background
Sass and jquery are in use, and this project started with a [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) framework.


## Images

The images folder is a mix of stuff I made and stuff from a parallax demo, and other stuff I don't own. I should fix that...
